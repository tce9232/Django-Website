              <p><em>The Data Collective</em> is a collection of data-driven articles written by professionals in data science or related fields. People in these fields tend to run incredibly insightful analyses and 
                are highly motivated to shed light on complex issues, but most of this time and energy usually ends up going towards improving the bottom line of a tech giant or consulting firm. This blog aims to become 
                an outlet for data scientists and others to analyze and post about topics in which they're independently passionate. 
              <p><em>The Data Collective</em> is entirely funded by donations from our readers. All of <i>The Data Collective</i>â€™s editorial decisions and judgments are made independently and not on the basis of donor support.</p>
              <p>The opinions and views expressed in <em>The Data Collective</em> are those of the authors and not of any entities for which they work or any schools they attend.</p>
